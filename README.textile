h2. Description:

This bundle originated as a port of the "official Ruby Haml.tmbundle":http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle/.

Since a co-worker and I noticed that the plugin was mostly stagnant, we decided to try and update it to become slightly more 
useful.  I hope that you find this helpful in your day to day Haml workflow.  Please let me know how you like it and contribute 
if you can!

Also, once you pull the bundle down from Github... I have added an 'Update Bundle' menu selection.  No need to go back to the 
command line for updates.

h2. Installation:

  # cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
  # git clone git://github.com/mattpolito/ruby-haml.tmbundle.git Ruby-Haml.tmbundle
